Three datasets were used in this project:
1. ballons.csv
2. titanic_test.csv
3. titanic_train.csv

In q2_decision_tree.ipynb, a decision tree was constructed. 
Then entropy and information gain was calculated to find the best split.
All of this was used to find the best feature.

In q3_models.ipynb, 2 data sets were read in. I had to perform data analysis and clean up to make sure I could run Logistic Regression, 
Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machines

This was a great project to learn how to use Pandas, sklearn modules, and some machine learning models.
